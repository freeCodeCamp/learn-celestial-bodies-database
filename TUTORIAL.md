# Celestial Bodies Database

> Welcome! Are you ready to build a database of the universe?

## 1. Instructions

For this project, you need to log in to to PostgreSQL with psql to create your database. Do that by entering `psql --username=freecodecam --dbname=postgres` in the terminal. Be sure to get creative, and have fun!

Here's some ideas for other column and table names: `description`, `has_life`, `is_spherical`, `age_in_millions_of_years`, `planet_types`, `galaxy_types`, `distance_from_earth`.

If you leave your virtual machine, your database will not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering `pg_dump --clean --create --inserts --username=freecodecamp universe > universe.sql` in a terminal (not the psql one). Make sure you are in the `project` folder when entering the command. It will save the commands to rebuild your database to `universe.sql`. Then, save the file somewhere. You can rebuild it by entering `psql -U postgres < universe.sql` in a terminal if you enter the command where the `.sql` file is.

**Don't forget to connect to your database after you create it** :smile:

### 1.1

Complete the tasks below

#### SUBTASKS

- You should create a database named `universe`
- Be sure to connect to your database with `\c universe`. Then, you should add tables named `galaxy`, `star`, `planet`, and `moon`
- Each table should have a primary key
- Each primary key should automatically increment
- Each table should have a `name` column
- You should use the `INT` data type for at least two columns that are not a primary or foreign key
- You should use the `NUMERIC` data type at least once
- You should use the `TEXT` data type at least once
- You should use the `BOOLEAN` data type on at least two columns
- Each "star" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in `galaxy`
- Each "planet" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in `star`
- Each "moon" should have a foreign key that references one of the rows in `planet`
- Your database should have at least five tables
- Each table should have at least three rows
- The `galaxy` and `star` tables should each have at least six rows
- The `planet` table should have at least 12 rows
- The `moon` table should have at least 20 rows
- Each table should have at least three columns
- The `galaxy`, `star`, `planet`, and `moon` tables should each have at least five columns
- At least two columns per table should not accept `NULL` values
- At least one column from each table should be required to be `UNIQUE`
- All columns named `name` should be of type `VARCHAR`
- Each primary key column should follow the naming convention `table_name_id`. For example, the `moon` table should have a primary key column named `moon_id`
- Each foreign key column should have the same name as the column it is referencing.
