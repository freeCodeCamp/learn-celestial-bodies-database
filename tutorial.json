Be sure to get creative, and have fun!\n\nHere's some ideas for other column and table names: `description`, `has_life`, `is_spherical`, `age_in_millions_of_years`, `planet_types`, `galaxy_types`, `distance_from_earth`.\n\nIf you leave your virtual machine, your database will not be saved. You can make a dump of it by entering `pg_dump --clean --create --inserts --username=freecodecamp universe > universe.sql` in a terminal (not the psql one). Make sure you are in the `project` folder when entering the command. It will save the commands to rebuild your database to `universe.sql`. Then, save the file somewhere. You can rebuild it by entering `psql -U postgres < universe.sql` in a terminal if you enter the command where the `.sql` file is.\n\n**Don't forget to connect to your database after you create it** :smile:",
